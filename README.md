# Protecting Wildlife on Florida’s Roads

## Overview
This project explores where and when wildlife-vehicle collisions happen across Florida’s state parks. The goal is to support smarter planning for wildlife crossings and safer roads for animals and people.

## Business Problem
Every year, animals are killed on Florida’s roads, which is dangerous for both drivers and wildlife populations. This project analyzes collision patterns using data from Florida state parks to identify hotspots and trends. By pinpointing where collisions occur most often, we aim to inform decisions on where wildlife crossings or other interventions could have the greatest impact.

## Dataset
The dataset used comes from Dryad and contains over 9,000 wildlife-vehicle collision records across 42 Florida state parks from 2005 to 2015. Each record includes park name, species involved, number of animals hit, road type, and park attendance numbers.

## Methods
Summary statistics and visualizations such as bar charts, scatter plots, and grouped counts were used to identify parks with the most collisions, risky months, road types, and possible correlations with park attendance and size.

## Key Findings
- Wildlife-vehicle collisions are unevenly distributed among parks; John Pennekamp Coral Reef State Park, Big Talbot Island, and Jonathan Dickinson have the highest collision rates.  
- Late summer and fall see the most collisions, with spring also elevated and winter months fewer.  
- Roads going through parks with higher speeds have more collisions than smaller internal park roads.  
- Park attendance does not strongly correlate with collision numbers.  
- The most commonly involved species include opossums, raccoons, armadillos, squirrels, and snakes.

## Assumptions and Limitations
- Collisions are likely underreported, especially for smaller animals.  
- Data ends in 2015 and may not reflect current trends.  
- Variations in park reporting practices may affect data consistency.

## Recommendations
- Parks with historically high collision numbers are likely priority areas for interventions such as wildlife crossings.  
- Updated data collection and a shared reporting system across parks could improve future analysis and safety measures.

## Implementation Plan
Develop a unified reporting system, possibly including a visitor app for real-time sightings and roadkill reports, to enhance data coverage and support effective mitigation strategies.

## Ethical Considerations
This project recognizes the real-life consequences of wildlife deaths and stresses the importance of using data respectfully to promote safety and conservation without misrepresenting or unfairly judging individual parks.

## Deliverables
- Analysis report and presentation  
- Code and visualizations used in the project
