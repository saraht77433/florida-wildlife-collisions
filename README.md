# Protecting Wildlife on Florida’s Roads

## Overview
A data-driven analysis identifying hotspots and patterns of wildlife-vehicle collisions in Florida’s state parks. This project aims to inform conservation efforts and improve road safety for both wildlife and humans.

## Tools & Data
- **Data sources:** Florida state parks wildlife-vehicle collision reports  
- **Tools:** Python, R, GIS software for spatial analysis and visualization

## Key Findings
- Specific areas within Florida’s state parks have significantly higher collision rates.  
- Temporal patterns show peak collision times that correlate with animal movement behaviors.  
- Recommendations for targeted mitigation measures based on spatial analysis.

## Deliverables
- Interactive maps highlighting collision hotspots  
- Analytical reports and visualizations supporting conservation strategies

## Purpose
To support wildlife protection and road safety initiatives by leveraging spatial data analysis to identify and communicate collision risk areas.
